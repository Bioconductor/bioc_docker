        # The following variable (use_numbered_branch) is only relevant if
        # use_r_devel is true.
        # use_numbered_branch should be false OR should be the (quoted) version number from
        # which to pull R. Set to false if you want to use the default R installed
        # by rocker, which pulls from trunk. Or set to a number (i.e. 3.2) to
        # install R from that branch. This is appropriate when R-devel becomes R-alpha.
        # For example, around March 19th, 2015, an R-3-2-branch was created and
        # the R in trunk became R-3.3. However, the contemporaneous Bioconductor
        # devel branch uses R-3.2, NOT 3.3, so we would set the below variable
        # to "3.2" (be sure to quote the value so it's forced to be a string).
